# Phon-Prediction

Eye tracking studies of children's and adults generation of online expectations about the sound of upcoming words.

**Experiment 1** examines 3- to 4-year-olds generation of phonological and semantic predictions. Children hear high cloze 
sentences while viewing pictures. In the semantic condition, one picture is semantically related to the expected word. In the phonological condition, one picture is phonologically related to the expected word. We examine predictive movements to these target pictures.
